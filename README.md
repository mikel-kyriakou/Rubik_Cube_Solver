# Rubik_Cube_Solver
This is a rubik cube solver using simple machine learning methods.

This does not solve every rubik cube, but mostly simple ones. Thats because this is a project given to us and we has instructions to try and solve it using the A* algorith which is a simple algorithm and it is not possible to solve every cube.
